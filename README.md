I want to make a website blocker that runs on Windows Desktop. 
This app blocks the user's access to a list of unproductive websites/apps (e.g. SNS, youtube, etc)
This blocker also sets the list of productive websites/apps (e.g. Microsoft office, VSCode, etc)
If the user work on productive websites/apps for a defined duration of time (say, 2 hours), then the blocker lifts the ban on unproductive websites/apps, effectively giving a reward to the user
